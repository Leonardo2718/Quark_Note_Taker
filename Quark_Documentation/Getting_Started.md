#Getting Started with Quark Note Taker

##Installation
1. Install **all** of Quark's dependencies:
    - The latest version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - The latest version of [PyQt5](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5)
    - The latest version of the Python module for [Markdown](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown)
    - *Note: make sure the python modules are installed correctly and that they are working*
2. Download Quark:
    - download and extract the [zip file](https://github.com/Leonardo2718/Quark_Note_Taker/archive/master.zip), or
    - download from the [GitHub page](https://github.com/Leonardo2718/Quark_Note_Taker) or
    - clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Leonardo2718/Quark_Note_Taker.git`
3. To run Quark, simply run the file named `quark.py`
    - *Note: on Windows, you may need to change the extension from `.py` to `.pyw`*
4. When you first run Quark, you will be prompted to create a new directory to store all your
Quark notes.  Files which are stored in this directory will be shown in the Quark notes
manager.  It is recommended that you keep this directory **for Quark notes only**.  If you
need to add files which are stored in a different directory, you should create a link to
those files inside you notes directory.
5. Once you've created the notes directory, you can start start using Quark normally.
